              "question": "Do I pay my rent through Andal?",
              "answer": "No. You continue paying rent directly to your landlord exactly as you do today, whether that's e-transfer, bank transfer, cheque, or any other method.\n\nAndal does not process rent payments, does not hold tenant funds, and does not sit between you and your landlord."
            },
            "whyProof": {
              "question": "Then why do you ask for proof of rent payment?",
              "answer": "Proof of payment is used only after you've already paid your landlord directly.\n\nWe use it to:\n• Confirm you paid on time (so we can award rewards)\n• Track participation in our early access program\n• Test whether positive incentives improve tenant experience\n\nThink of it like submitting a receipt to earn cash back: we're verifying an action that already happened, not processing the payment itself."
            },
            "whatProof": {
              "question": "What kind of proof do you need?",
              "answer": "Simple, non-invasive proof such as:\n• Screenshot of an e-transfer confirmation\n• Bank transaction confirmation showing the payment\n• Receipt from your landlord (if they provide one)\n\nWe do NOT ask for:\n• Full bank statements\n• Account passwords\n• Sensitive financial data\n\nYou control what you share. Most tenants send a quick screenshot that shows the date, amount, and recipient — nothing more."
            },
            "handleMoney": {
              "question": "Does Andal handle my money?",
              "answer": "No.\n\nAndal:\n• Does not touch your rent money\n• Does not move money between you and your landlord\n• Does not act as a payment processor\n• Never holds tenant funds\n\nAll rent payments happen directly between you and your landlord, outside our platform."
